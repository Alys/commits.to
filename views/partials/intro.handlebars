This is a commitment logger.
Create a commitment by constructing a URL like 
"<b>alice.promises.to/send_the_report</b>"
and just by clicking on such a URL, a promise is logged here.
We're working on the rest of the implementation, where you can mark promises
fulfilled and everyone can see statistics on your reliability.
